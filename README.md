# AI prediction model

This repo contains the code and the report for the project of the 10 ECTS course Computer Vision and Machine Learning. @AU. Spring 2022

The aim of this project is to develop a clinical decisionmaking model for determining patient-specific risk factors for knee arthroplasty survival and complications. The problem is formulated as a binary classification problem aiming to predict if a future failure of the knee implant can be expected or not based on the potential risk factors of a patient.
